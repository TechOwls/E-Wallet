This file contains all the links associated with the HTML.

## What is HTML

    - HTML is responsible for the visible components on web.
    - HTML is basic and usually ugly
    - HTML work based on tags

## Important HTML Stuff

    - Most of the stuff we do is inside the body <body> </body>
    - The only thing we do above body is give name for the title and link to establish the link between CSS and HTML
    - There are two kinds of tags
        1. Similar to {} HTML uses something called Tags.
            -> Tag is something defined inside <> notation. These are functionalities that we use to  create our web page
            -> Usually most of the tags have a opening tag <something> and a closing tag </something>
            -> Opening tag marks the begining of the scope and works similar to {
            -> Closing tag marks the ending of the scope and works similar to }
        2. Self closing tags
            -> Tags that dont need closing tag

### Some important tags

    - p: is used for paragphs
        HTML by itself doesnt have "enter funstionality". Inorder to input a new line we can use the p or br tags (br is a self closing tag)
    - br: as mentioned before it is a tag used to insert a line between two components
    - button: as name specifies its a button
    - div: its does nothing visually but is used for styling and division purposes
    - a: used to insert hyperlinks
    - image: used to insert images
    - h1 to h6: the heading styles h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest
    - link: used to refer the css file
    - script: used to refer the js file
