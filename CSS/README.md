CSS is in charge for styling the page

## Some rules

    - CSS can be directly applied in the HTML file but its advised to practice by creating a new file coz of its euse value
    - We use link tag to link CSS with HTML
    - Link tag is above the body tag inside the head
    - CSS has priority type:
        use this to calculate the strenght of the tag: https://specificity.keegan.st/
    - Using class is prefered over ID for the reusability

## Frame Works

    - Tailwind - https://tailwindcss.com/
    - Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
    - We can use these frame works to avoid hours of css coding

Also its impossible to know everything, just get a decent idea of how its works and its more than enough.
